    Since both our standard model and our CAR model have been working relatively
    well on our simulated data, we moved onto running them on the actual data.

    The standard model ran without convergence issues on the 2003 data for all
    rivers, but it did not converge on any of the 2004 data.  We simplified the
    model by eliminating E in an attempt to improve convergence, which worked
    for the 402m Whitewater River and 402m Zumbro River data.  Although none of
    the Mississippi River's 2004 data converged, we are still including
    estimates for the 402m Mississippi River data.

    The CAR model did not converge for any of the data.  Although the standard
    model and the CAR model performed similarly in testing when both models
    converged, the standard model converged much more often than the CAR model
    did.  We think this is because the CAR model attempts to estimate too many
    parameters.  There is a different estimate of \(\theta\) for every site,
    which adds a considerable amount of complexity to the model.  We also tried
    to simplify this model by eliminating E, but this did not improve
    convergence.  Therefore, we are not going to include any estimates of
    parameters from the CAR model in this report.

    We decided not to run the models on the alternating plots. In our earlier
    analysis, we discovered that the main difference between alternating plots
    and all plots was that the alternating plots were more independent. When
    testing the standard model on spatially dependent simulated data, we found
    that the estimates were fairly accurate. The CAR model estimates were also
    fairly accurate on this simulated data, when it converged. Therefore, we
    decided to use the data that includes all plots because we feel that having
    the additional information from all plots is more important to the model
    than independence is.

    All of our estimates are below and are accompanied with some thoughts about
    their convergence.  We are wondering if these estimates seem reasonable,
    based upon what you know about the three rivers. \\

    While the 402m data converged well, E, \(\psi\), and \(\theta\) did not
