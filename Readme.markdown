# Otter Comps!  But mostly being frustrated by git.  
**Authors**: Kiva Oken, Sarah Halls, and Chrisna Aing  

I cannot believe that it is almost time to say goodbye (and graduate)!  And,
while I proved [George](http://drp.ly/pzye4+) wrong, git was not a godsend :(.

## Git

### Some Stuff You Should Do:

**Mac OS X**:

* [Generate](http://help.github.com/mac-key-setup/) and add a new SSH key.
* [Set](http://help.github.com/git-email-settings/) your username, e-mail, and
  GitHub token.
* Enter the command `git config --global core.autocrlf input`.*

**Windows**:

* [Generate](http://help.github.com/msysgit-key-setup/) and add a new SSH key.
* [Set](http://help.github.com/git-email-settings/) your username, e-mail, and
  GitHub token.
* Enter the command `git config --global core.autocrlf true`.

### Tutorials:

1. [Read this first].  You will want to skip to the point about cloning an
   existing repository.  The existing repository will be this one, the link to
   which can be found near the top of the page!  The tutorial will teach you the
   basics you will need to know, which I hope is all we need to get this thing
   done.  And then you will be able to show this to all of your friends!
2. [Working with the repository].  This is an overview of the commands you will
   use to interact with the online version of our paper and presentation.

Goodbye!
