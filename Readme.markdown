# Otter Comps!  And learning (a little bit) about git, perhaps!
**Authors**: Chrisna Aing, Sarah Halls, and Kiva Oken  

There will be a first draft of this paper here by Thursday, February 18, 2010!
Otherwise, we will all be dead.  A presentation should also appear at some point
and it will also be written in LaTeX, obv.  

Some tutorials and best practices with respect to using git and collaborating on
a LaTeX document will show up shortly (maybe).  

Goodbye!
